# Lowering Barriers to Contributing to R

A keynote talk for [LatinR](https://latinr.org/) 2025.

## Abstract

It is 30 years since R was released under an open source license and today R is  
used by millions of people worldwide. Ensuring that R remains a solid 
foundation for people's work requires ongoing development and maintenance. 
The general R community can play an important part in sustaining R for the 
future. In this keynote, I'll share some recent initiatives 
that lower barriers to contribution.

We'll explore two tools that simplify the process of contributing: Weblate for 
contributing translations of errors, warnings and messages, and the R Dev 
Container for contributing to the code and documentation. These tools require 
minimal setup, so you can focus on the interesting work! 

We'll discover how these tools have been used by participants at collaborative 
events - translation hackathons and R Dev Days - organised by 
the R Contribution Working Group in recent years. Finally, I’ll 
discuss how you can find tasks, get support, and start contributing, so that 
together we can ensure R continues to thrive for decades to come.
